The following ABNF grammar defines the Rainbow protocol:

    rainbow_msg     = *(  subscribe |  publish |  deliver |  wtf )

    ;         Subscribe to a channel
    C:subscribe     = signature %d1 channel
    signature       = %xAA %xA0             ; two octets
    channel         = string                ; Name of channel

    ;         Publish an event to a channel
    C:publish       = signature %d2 channel content
    channel         = string                ; Name of channel
    content         = frame                 ; Content frame

    ;         Deliver a new event off a channel
    S:deliver       = signature %d3 channel content
    channel         = string                ; Name of channel
    content         = frame                 ; Content frame

    ;         Reject client command with error
    S:wtf           = signature %d4 reason
    reason          = string                ; Error reason

    ; A frame is zero or more octets encoded as a ZeroMQ frame
    frame           = *OCTET

    ; Strings are always length + text contents
    string          = number-1 *VCHAR

    ; Numbers are unsigned integers in network byte order
    number-1        = 1OCTET
